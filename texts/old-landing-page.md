<h2>Success story from Carvago</h2>

**Old flow:**
1) Push
2) CI runs for 20 minutes - 15 minutes Rector run reveals code improvement and fails a pipeline
3) Developer fixes the bug
4) Pushes & another 20 minutes of CI


**New improved flow With PHP Mate:**
1) Push
2) CI runs for 10 minutes & succeeds, because Rector is no longer directly part of pipeline, but delegated to PHP Mate
3) Next day there is pull request awaiting with all Rector fixes from previous day
4) It takes 2 minutes to review + merge

This way Carvago saved tens of minutes every day, for every developer in the company.  
Now, time can be spent in much better way than waiting for CI pipeline.

#### TODO: Future plans, possible features

- You can delegate many tasks to me, it does not have to result into a PR - etc i can be responsible for your cron jobs
- You can define more complex pipelines / work schedule for me, I can do it!
