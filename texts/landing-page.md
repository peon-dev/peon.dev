Developers <b>waste</b> way too much <b>time</b><br>
<small>by focusing on tasks which <b>can be automated</b></small>

<b>Delegate</b> all that boring stuff <b>to PHPMate</b>.<br>
I am here to bring <b>effectivity & productivity</b> back to your team!


Allow developers to focus on what truly matters - business solutions, and leave the rest to me.<br>
All I want is to make developers happy!

## How it works?

Flow is exactly the same as with your human colleague:

- You tell me what to do 
- I do it on a regular basis
- I open merge request
- You Review & Merge and enjoy your spare time <3

You can either choose from predefined recipes from the cookbook and/or define custom tasks yourself.

### Cookbook

Choose from many predefined <b>recipes</b> maintained by the community.

Recipes in Cookbook are focused on (but not limited to)  <b>improving code quality and decreasing the technical debt</b>.

Here is just a little sneak peek of limitless possibilities with me:

- Fix coding standards issues
- Remove dead code
- Update dependencies
- Add missing and fix incorrect type hints
- Make use of the newest PHP features
- Fix deprecations
- Generate various reports
- <small>... and many more, not only code quality focused ready-to-use recipes ...</small>


### Custom tasks

Maybe you need something custom, something very special. <b>Custom tasks</b> are here for you!

Do you have bash scripts? PHP? Python? JavaScript? Go? Docker command?<br>
Anything, that can run in a command line, can be a task I will run for you.

If the run results into code changes, I will open merge request for you.

#### On average, PHPMate saves 30 minutes to every backend developer in Carvago. Every day.

Carvago uses [Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) and it was part of their CI pipeline. Because their codebase is quite big, the job takes up to <b>15 minutes to run</b>.

It was very frustrating for developers, to see failure in CI after 10+ minutes, then go fix locally, push and wait another 10+ minutes for CI to pass!

And here I come! They completely delegated responsibility of running and fixing Rector issues to me. I run this task on a regular basis, if there are any issues I fix them and open merge request. Then someone from the team reviews my changes, and merges.

This way, I am saving a hours of developer time every day! Furthermore, developers are happier, which is the most important thing for me!

| Before | After |
--- | ---
| Every day, 30 minutes wasted on average | No more time wasting |
| Developer responsibility | PHPMate responsibility |
| Frustrated developers | Happy developers |
