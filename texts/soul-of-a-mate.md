# Product

## Strengths

- Very strong technical background
- Does not require big effort to deliver product as it is manily built on top of other open source tool
- Very good timing - now in corona many companies are focusing on their technical debt as they understand it is now more important than ever to have e-presence
- Not sure,... there will be many but i already mentioned in competitive advantages

## Weaknesses

- Not a full-time job
- "Fighting with demons"
- New competitors might arise quickly as it is not really rocket-science and the idea is really simple - built on top of other open source tool
- It is built on open source - even if we are very good friends with the main author and I (Honza) am co-author, this might turn into weakness if the rector tool gets totally different direction (it is very less likely to happen but I feel like it is important to mention)

## Competitors

- Companies that focus on technical debt - not exactly what we do (reporting, not fixing): stepsize.com, codacy.com, sonarqube.org, deepsource.io
- Services that sends merge requests with improvements: snyk.io (focus on security), dependabot.com (solves only dependencies), renovatebot.com (solves only dependencies)
- There is no service that is doing exactly what we are :-) - the closest is laravelshift.com -> it focuses on Laravel framework
- https://buddy.works/php - Overall buddy is very nice product. It is not focused on delivering updates of the code, but it could be easily integrated with some custom scripts. It is very complex platform for creating automated workflows with beautiful GUI. 

## Competitive advantage
- Experience with many legacy codebases
- Big community reach + well known in community
- Co-authoring of the Rector tool
- Contacts in local PHP companies

## Personas
- Who is our user? Is it an enterprise only? Is it a one person external contractor?
	- Users are PHP developers. It can be team of any size. They must use one of Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket. Even single developer can use PHP Mate in his personal project. We want to offer free for open source tier.

- Who is our client?
	- Companies with PHP codebases. Could be business of any size (1+). Biggest benefits are for bigger companies as more developers = more saved time. 

- What kind of businesses are using PHPmate?
	- Now they are companies with 5-30 PHP developers, but size does not matter.
